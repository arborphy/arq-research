TRAIT_SYNONYMS.JSON ENHANCEMENT TASKS
Date: December 29, 2025
Project: ArborQuest Research - Botanical Trait Synonyms

================================================================================
TASK SUMMARY
================================================================================

Task #1: Add Missouri Botanical Garden Source
----------------------------------------------
Add new authoritative source to trait_synonyms.json:
- URL: https://www.mobot.org/mobot/latindict/search_text.aspx
- Source: Missouri Botanical Garden Latin Dictionary
- Type: Online botanical dictionary/reference
- Actions:
  a) Add to "sources" section with proper metadata
  b) Look up ALL terms currently defined in trait_synonyms.json in the Missouri
     Botanical Garden Latin Dictionary
  c) Add MOBOT_LATIN to "synonymToSource" for each term found in their dictionary
  d) Add MOBOT_LATIN definitions to "synonymDefinitions" for each term found

Task #2: Identify High Trust Sources
-------------------------------------
Create a curated subset of "High Trust Sources" for botanical definitions:
- Add "highTrustSources" section to trait_synonyms.json
- Include only the most authoritative institutional and peer-reviewed sources
- High Trust Sources:
  * Planteome (https://planteome.org/) - Plant ontology consortium
  * KEW_GLOSSARY - Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew
  * MOBOT_LATIN - Missouri Botanical Garden
  * PLANT_ONTOLOGY - OBO Foundry (linked to Planteome)
  * NEWCOMB - Foundational reference for this project
  * EBSCO_LEAF - Peer-reviewed academic article
  * PMC_TRY_PUBLICATION - Peer-reviewed journal article
  * USDA_PLANTS - U.S. government database
- Exclude general Wikipedia sources from high trust designation
- Document why each source qualifies as high trust

Task #3: Ensure Completeness/Coherence of Botanical Terms
----------------------------------------------------------
Review all definitions for undefined botanical terms:
- Scan definitions for technical botanical terms (e.g., "inflorescence", "node", 
  "whorl", "sessile", "involucre", etc.)
- Ensure each botanical term used in a definition is itself defined somewhere
  in the synonymDefinitions section
- Add missing term definitions as needed
- Create cross-references between related terms

Task #4: Add Common Language Definitions
-----------------------------------------
Create accessible definitions for non-botanists:
- Base definitions on most trustworthy sources (Kew, USDA, Missouri Botanical Garden)
- Replace botanical jargon with common language equivalents
- Add parenthetical explanations for technical terms that must be retained
- Examples:
  * "sessile" → "without a stalk" or "directly attached"
  * "node" → "the point on a stem where leaves attach"
  * "whorl" → "a ring-like arrangement"
- Add a new section or field for "commonLanguageDefinition" alongside technical
  definitions

================================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH
================================================================================

Step 1: Add Missouri Botanical Garden source (Task #1)
Step 2: Audit existing definitions for completeness (Task #3)
Step 3: Add multiple source definitions where applicable (Task #2)
Step 4: Create common language definitions (Task #4)
Step 5: Validate JSON structure and run consistency checks

================================================================================
NOTES
================================================================================

- Maintain existing structure and formatting conventions
- Preserve all source attributions and page references
- Keep definitions scientifically accurate while improving accessibility
- Run validation checks after each major change
- Document any ambiguities or questions that arise during implementation

================================================================================
TASK #4 PLAN: COMMON LANGUAGE DEFINITIONS FOR NON-BOTANISTS
================================================================================
Created: 2025-12-29 4:08 PM EST

OBJECTIVE:
Add "commonLanguageDefinition" field to definitions while keeping original source
definitions intact. Create accessible versions for non-botanists by replacing
botanical jargon with common language or adding helpful explanations.

APPROACH:
Add new "commonLanguageDefinition" field alongside existing "definition" field.
Original definitions remain unchanged from authoritative sources.

Structure Example:
{
  "node": {
    "definition": "The part of a stem where one or more leaves, branches, or aerial roots are attached",
    "commonLanguageDefinition": "The point on a plant stem where leaves attach (like a joint on your finger)",
    "source": "KEW_GLOSSARY",
    "page": 71
  }
}

If original is already accessible, duplicate it:
{
  "prostrate": {
    "definition": "Lying flat on the ground",
    "commonLanguageDefinition": "Lying flat on the ground",
    "source": "KEW_GLOSSARY"
  }
}

METHODOLOGY:

Phase 1: Prioritize Terms (10 minutes)
---------------------------------------
- Start with 19 general botanical terms (most foundational)
- Then address complex existing definitions
- Priority: Critical terms > Structural > Morphological > Plant parts

Phase 2: Create Common Language Definitions (40-50 minutes)
------------------------------------------------------------
- KEEP original "definition" field exactly as is from source
- ADD new "commonLanguageDefinition" field with accessible version
- Replace technical botanical terms with common equivalents
- Add helpful analogies or parenthetical explanations
- If original is already accessible, duplicate it
- Target audience: educated non-botanists (citizen scientists, students)

Translation Examples:
- sessile: "Without a stalk; attached directly by the base"
  → "Attached directly without a stem (like a button sewn flat onto fabric)"
- whorl: "An arrangement of three or more similar organs radiating from a single node"
  → "Three or more leaves arranged in a ring around the stem at the same point"
- inflorescence: "The arrangement of flowers on a plant; the flowering part of a plant"
  → "The flowering part of a plant; how the flowers are arranged on the stem"

Phase 3: Review & Validate (10 minutes)
----------------------------------------
- Ensure original definitions unchanged
- Check common language versions for accuracy and clarity
- Validate JSON structure

RESOURCE ESTIMATE:
------------------
Time: 60-70 minutes total
Terms to Process:
  - 19 general botanical terms (priority)
  - ~30 complex existing definitions
  - Total: ~50 definitions
Files Modified:
  - trait_synonyms.json (add commonLanguageDefinition to ~50 entries)
  - KiloCode Task 29Dec 3p.txt (update with completion status)

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
-----------------
✓ Original "definition" fields remain unchanged from sources
✓ New "commonLanguageDefinition" fields added to all target terms
✓ Common language versions are accurate and accessible
✓ Definitions understandable to non-botanists
✓ JSON structure valid
