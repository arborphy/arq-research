# If you want to use a Snowflake Programmatic Access Token (PAT):
# - Generate a PAT in Snowsight (Governance & security → Users & roles → <user> → Programmatic access tokens)
# - Snowflake supports using a PAT as a password for drivers/clients.
# - Recommended: do NOT put the token secret into this file. Instead, set it at runtime:
#     export SNOWFLAKE_PAT_FILE="$HOME/.config/snowflake/pat.token"
#     export password="$(cat "$SNOWFLAKE_PAT_FILE")"
# - Keep this file out of git and rotate tokens regularly.
